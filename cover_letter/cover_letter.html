                Dear Valentina Klimenko,
            </p>
            <p>
                I hope this message finds you well. I'm excited to apply for the position of , <strong>Customer Support Database Engineer</strong> that you mentioned. With a strong background in <strong>data analysis</strong> and over 10 years of experience in <strong>customer service</strong>, I bring a unique combination of technical expertise and client-focused problem-solving skills that align with the requirements of this role.
            </p>
            <p>
                As part of my professional development, I have worked extensively on <strong>SQL</strong> (PostgreSQL, MySQL) through hands-on projects, where I designed and optimized queries, managed relational <strong>databases</strong>, and created ETL pipelines to process and analyze data efficiently. For example, I automated data integration workflows that reduced manual processing time, demonstrating my ability to work with complex data systems. These experiences, although project-based, reflect my commitment to mastering database management tools and methodologies.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition, my years as a Cashier Supervisor in retail have honed my interpersonal skills and ability to handle client interactions with empathy and professionalism. I have experience resolving issues under pressure, ensuring smooth communication between teams, and training staff to meet operational goals. These skills are invaluable when supporting customers and translating technical concepts into clear, actionable solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to contribute to your team by combining my technical skills and customer-oriented mindset. I look forward to discussing how my abilities can meet the needs of this role.
            </p>
